Security Considerations

Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using a key before being stored locally. Make sure to keep the encryption key secure.
Local Storage: Passwords are stored in an encrypted format in a local file or SQLite database, minimizing the risk of exposure to online threats. Ensure that access to this file is restricted on your device.
This tool is meant for educational purposes or personal use only and should not replace more robust solutions for managing sensitive information.
